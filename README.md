## To the Code Reviewer  
**Edstem Technologies**  

During the initial submission of this repository, I was unable to incorporate a few key requirements, including:  

- Implementing JUnit for testing  
- Adding the `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency  

Since then, I have worked on completing these missing requirements and improving the overall implementation, ensuring better adherence to Java coding standards. The updated version of the project is available in the following repository:  

ðŸ”— **GitHub Repository:** [Edstem-Product-Inventory-Management-API](https://github.com/7rensenS/Edstem-Product-Inventory-Management-API.git)  
ðŸ”— **Link:** https://github.com/7rensenS/Edstem-Product-Inventory-Management-API.git

If possible, kindly consider reviewing this updated version as well to better understand my approach to Java and Spring Boot application development.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to join **Edstem Technologies**.  

**Best regards,**  
**Rensen S**
